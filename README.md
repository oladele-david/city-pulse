## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Issue Ingestion** - Community reports aggregated from multiple channels
2. **AI Processing** - Confidence scoring and validation
3. **Dashboard Display** - Real-time visualization and analytics
4. **Agency Action** - Status updates and resolution tracking
5. **Analytics** - Historical trend analysis and insights

---

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration enforced
- Component-driven architecture
- Functional components with hooks

### Naming Conventions
- **Components** - PascalCase (e.g., `DashboardLayout`)
- **Files** - PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities
- **CSS Classes** - Tailwind utilities, no custom CSS unless necessary

### State Management
- Server state via TanStack Query
- Form state via React Hook Form
- Local state via React hooks
- No global state management library (intentional simplicity)

---

## 📈 Performance Optimization

- Code splitting via React Router
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimized bundle size with Vite
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo where appropriate
- Virtualized lists for large datasets (planned)
